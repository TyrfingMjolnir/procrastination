... but it's not


In the lack of ADHD or some sort of light autism there might be a different thing that happens when you are not allowed to act when you feel like it. I work the better when I'm able to front-load; meaning I'm able to do a task right away, not having to make a deal with somebody for the task to be allowed to be done. The key to my success is the ability to front-load. Why? Because if I'm not allowed to do so I will become paralyzed; possibly by shame?
